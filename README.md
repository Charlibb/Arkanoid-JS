The classic 80Â´s arcade game, Arkanoid, made entirely on Javascript!

# Basic Concepts of the Game Code

## Key Elements:

- **Canvas:** The game is rendered on an HTML5 canvas element.
- **Game Loop:** The `draw()` function continuously renders the game elements, creating animation.
- **Input Handling:** The `initEvents()` function listens for keyboard input to control the paddle.
- **Objects:** The game utilizes objects for the ball, paddle, and bricks.

## Key Functions:

- `drawBall()`: Draws the ball on the canvas.
- `drawPaddle()`: Draws the paddle on the canvas.
- `drawBricks()`: Draws the bricks on the canvas.
- `collisionDetection()`: Checks for collisions between the ball and other objects.
- `ballMovement()`: Updates the ball's position and handles collisions with walls and the paddle.
- `paddleMovement()`: Updates the paddle's position based on keyboard input.

## Game Structure:

### Initialization:

- Canvas is set up.
- Ball, paddle, and bricks are initialized with their properties.
- Event listeners are added for keyboard input.

### Game Loop:

- The `draw()` function is repeatedly called:
  - The canvas is cleared.
  - Objects are drawn on the canvas.
  - Object movement and collisions are handled.
  - The screen is updated.
